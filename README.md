<h1>**Linked List Implementation in C++**</h1>
Welcome to the Linked List repository! 🚀 In this repository, you'll find a C++ implementation of a linked list. Linked lists are dynamic data structures that provide efficient insertion and deletion of elements compared to arrays.

<h2>**Linked List Overview **📚</h2>

A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes, and each node points to the next node in the sequence. The last node points to nullptr, indicating the end of the list.

<h2>**Key Differences from Arrays** 🔄</h2>

<h4>**Dynamic Size**:</h4> Unlike arrays, linked lists do not have a fixed size. They can dynamically grow or shrink during runtime.
<h4>**Memory Allocation**:</h4> Linked lists use dynamic memory allocation, allowing them to utilize memory more efficiently.
<h4>**Insertion/Deletion**:</h4> Inserting or deleting elements in a linked list is more efficient than in an array, especially in the middle.


<h2>**Types of Linked Lists** 📝</h2>

<h3>1. **Singly Linked List** 📌</h3>

  In a singly linked list, each node points to the next node in the sequence.
  Simple and memory-efficient.

<h3>2.** Doubly Linked List** 📎</h3>

  Nodes in a doubly linked list have pointers to both the next and previous nodes.
  Enables easy traversal in both directions.
  
<h3>3.** Circular Linked List** 🔄</h3>

  In a circular linked list, the last node points back to the first node, forming a circle.
  Useful in applications requiring circular navigation.
  
<h2>**Code Structure **🖥️</h2>

The C++ code in this repository provides a basic implementation of a singly linked list and doubly linked list . It includes operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.
